# proj201

This project was made for the Proj201 course, a course required to be taken by all undergraduate students at Sabanci University. The aim of this project is to detect the districts, neighbourhoods, and ballot boxes that best approximated the results of the previous 2014 and 2019 Istanbul Municipality elections. Analyzing the electorates of these areas, one can have a good understanding of what the next election is going to result in.


Features planned to be included in the future commits:
- Writing all results to a file in a sorted order starting from the best approximation
- Analyzing 2014 and 2019 elections at the same time to get even a better insight
- Creating an API that gets the coordinates of the location it is given
- Making a GUI application that shows the locations of constituencies that best approximated the previous elections to provide a visual view of the results
